Brazil's president tested for COVID-19

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro says he has been experiencing symptoms of the novel coronavirus and was tested for the disease.

Bolsonaro said in an interview with CNN Brasil on Monday that he has symptoms such as a fever.
He said he expects the results of the test on Tuesday and has canceled all his official duties for the rest of the week. The president's office said in a statement that the president is at his home and is "in good health."

Bolsonaro has been heard describing the virus as "a little flu" and has made it clear that he prioritizes economic activity.

The president has been criticized for belittling measures to prevent infections from spreading. He has often appeared in public without a mask and has been ordered by a court to wear one.

Under Bolsonaro's economic policies, soccer matches are resuming, restaurants are reopening and business activity is picking up again.

Concerns are mounting that the virus may continue to spread in Brazil where more than 1.6 million infections have been reported, the second-highest number after the United States.
